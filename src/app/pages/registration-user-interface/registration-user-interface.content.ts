A first beta of the CCF RUI became available in October 2020. The CCF RUI specification is available here, 3D reference organs are freely available on the CCF Portal, the ontology can be found on BioPortal, and the code is availble on GitHub. The registration data is used in current versions of the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF, see CCF Portal for details) and the CCF Exploration User Interface (EUI) developed within HuBMAP.`

        <ul>
            <li>Enter their name to track data provenance.</li>

            <li>Select a set of common tissue extraction sites.</li>
            <li>Size the tissue block in three dimensions.</li>
            <li>Enter information on tissue section thickness.</li>
            <li>Position and rotate the 3D tissue block so that its placement correctly mirrors the tissue block extraction site.</li>
            <li>Identify anatomical structure tags via collision detection and manual annotation.</li>
            <li>Save all registration information into a file for easy uploading to custom templates in REDCap (or other systems) used to keep track of tissue and tissue registration data. If using the RUI integrated into the HuBMAP Ingestion Portal, registration information is automatically saved with the associated tissue block.</li>
