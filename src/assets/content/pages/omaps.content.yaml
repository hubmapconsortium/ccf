    Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs) are collections of antibodies that allow spatial mapping of the anatomical structures and cell types present in diverse organs using multiplexed antibody-based imaging (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01316-y" target="">Hickey et al, 2021</a>). 
    The construction of an OMAP is an iterative, resource intensive process that requires domain expertise in tissue biology, spatial proteomics, and multiplexed imaging (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0206-y" target="">Du et al. 2019</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00644-9" target="">Radtke et al. 2022</a>). 
    To overcome these challenges, the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is authoring and publishing OMAPs. 
    These community-validated resources directly parallel efforts in the field of flow cytometry to publish Optimized Multicolor Immunofluorescence Panels (OMIPs) (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cyto.a.20916" target="">Mahnke, Chattopadhyay, and Roederer 2010</a>, 
    <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cyto.a.20959" target="">Roederer and Tárnok 2010</a>). In contrast to existing antibody validation resources such as the 
    <a href="https://avr.hubmapconsortium.org/" target="">HuBMAP Antibody Validation Report</a> and <a href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue" target="">Human Protein Atlas</a>, OMAPs additionally provide experimental details relevant for their successful application, e.g., tissue preservation method, imaging method, antigen retrieval conditions, and antibody cycling order. 
    The end result is an assembly of expertly curated antibodies that work together in a single tissue section. To facilitate tissue mapping efforts within and beyond the HuBMAP community, OMAPs are designed for integration with the ASCT+B Reporter 
    (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00788-6" target="">Börner et al. 2021</a>), a state-of-the-art visualization tool <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-asct-reporter" target="">https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-asct-reporter</a>.
    We strongly encourage inclusion of blood endothelial markers to empower construction of a human reference atlas using the vasculature common coordinate framework (VCCF), originally proposed by Dr. Zorina Galis 
    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYU_dsb0j4&ab_channel=CyberinfrastructureforNetworkScienceCenter%28CNS%29" target="">Galis 2019</a>) and expanded upon here (
