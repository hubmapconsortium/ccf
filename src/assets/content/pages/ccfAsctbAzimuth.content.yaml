  subtitle: Crosswalks from Azimuth cell annotation tool to ASCT+B tables will cell population data

overviewAzimuthData:
- heading: Overview
  descriptions: |
    <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/ccf-anatomical-structures.html" target="">ASCT+B tables</a> represent cell by gene (CxG) relationships that are also captured in the organ-specific HuBMAP <a href="https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/" target="_blank">Azimuth references</a>.
    This site provides cell type typology data from Azimuth that can be visualized in the <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-asct-reporter/" target="">ASCT+B Reporter</a>.


    We also provide easy access to results for comparing CxG in ASCT+B vs. CxG in Azimuth. In Jan 2022, Azimuth supports single-cell RNA-seq data exclusively. As more experimental data becomes available and additional types of data are supported (e.g., proteins, lipids, metabolites), data differences will decrease.
- heading: Azimuth Cell Type Typologies and Counts
  descriptions: In Jan 2022, eight molecular reference maps for human are available via Azimuth. For each we provide the cell type typology as a file that can be visualized in the ASCT+B Reporter together with a table that lists the annotation level and the number of cell types for each unique cell in the organ-specific Azimuth reference, see Table 1.
